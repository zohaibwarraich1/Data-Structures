# Data-Structures in C++
This repository contains a variety of data structures implemented in C++. The structure is well-organized into directories, each focusing on different data structures, algorithms, and their respective implementations. It includes detailed implementations of trees (like AVL Trees, Binary Search Trees), heaps (Max and Min), stacks, queues, linked lists, and graph algorithms. Additionally, the repository features sorting algorithms (such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, etc.) and searching techniques. Each directory is structured to focus on specific data structures and algorithms, offering practical examples and use cases to reinforce learning.

### Infix, Prefix, and Postfix Conversions:

          -> Algorithms to convert expressions between infix, prefix, and postfix notations
          -> Stack-based implementations for evaluating and converting expressions

### Search Algorithms:

          -> Linear Search: Basic searching technique with O(n) complexity
          -> Binary Search: Efficient searching on sorted data with O(log n) complexity

          -> Insertion Sort: Sorts elements by repeatedly inserting them into their correct position.
          -> Radix Sort: A non-comparative sorting algorithm based on digit grouping.
          -> Heap Sort: A sorting technique that uses a binary heap to sort elements efficiently.
          
### Linked Lists:

          -> Singly Linked List: Basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal
