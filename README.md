# Data-Structures
This repository contains a variety of data structures implemented in C++. The structure is well-organized into directories, each focusing on different data structures, algorithms, and their respective implementations.

## Detailed Topics Covered:
### AVL Trees:

          -> Self-balancing Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
          -> Rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL)
          -> Operations: Insertion, Deletion, and Balancing

## Binary Search Trees (BSTs):

          -> Basic operations: Insertion, Deletion, Search
          -> Traversal methods: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder

### Heaps:

          -> Max Heap: Implementation with support for insertion and deletion
          -> Min Heap: Similar operations with a focus on maintaining the minimum at the root

### Stacks:

          -> Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists
          -> Applications: Expression evaluation (Postfix, Prefix), and more

### Queues:

          -> Standard queue operations
          -> Circular Queue and Single Queue

### Infix, Prefix, and Postfix Conversions:

          -> Algorithms to convert expressions between infix, prefix, and postfix notations
          -> Stack-based implementations for evaluating and converting expressions

### Search Algorithms:

          -> Linear Search: Basic searching technique with O(n) complexity
          -> Binary Search: Efficient searching on sorted data with O(log n) complexity

### Sorting Algorithms:

          -> Bubble Sort: A simple, yet inefficient sorting method
          -> Selection Sort: Another basic sorting technique
          -> Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm
          -> Quick Sort: An efficient, recursive sorting technique with partitioning
          -> Insertion Sort: Sorts elements by repeatedly inserting them into their correct position.
          -> Radix Sort: A non-comparative sorting algorithm based on digit grouping.
          -> Heap Sort: A sorting technique that uses a binary heap to sort elements efficiently.
          
### Linked Lists:

          -> Singly Linked List: Basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal
          -> Doubly Linked List: Operations that support bidirectional traversal
          -> Circular Linked List: Similar operations with circular references

### Graphs:

          -> Graph representation using adjacency matrix and list
          -> Graph traversal techniques: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)
          -> Algorithms like Dijkstra's for shortest path
